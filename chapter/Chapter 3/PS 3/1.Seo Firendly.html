          Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of improving the
          quality and quantity of website traffic to a website or a web page
          from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_search_engine" target="_blank">search engines</a>.[1][2] SEO targets unpaid search traffic (usually
          referred to as "organic" results) rather than direct traffic, referral
          traffic, social media traffic, or paid traffic.[3] Organic search
          engine traffic originates from a variety of searches, including image
          search, video search, academic search,[4] news search,
          industry-specific vertical search engines, and large language models.
          As an Internet marketing strategy, SEO involves understanding how
          search engines operate, the algorithms that shape their results, the
          information users seek, the keywords and queries they enter, and the
          specific search engines favored by the intended audience. SEO helps
          websites attract more visitors from a search engine and rank higher
          within a search engine results page (SERP), aiming to either convert
          the visitors or build brand awareness.[5]
